# Twig Template Engine Benchmark Results

## Environment

- Go version: go1.24.1
- CPU: 8 cores
- GOMAXPROCS: 8
- Date: March 10, 2025

## Template Engine Comparison

Comprehensive benchmarking of several popular Go template engines:

| Engine      | Simple (µs/op) | Medium (µs/op) | Complex (µs/op) |
|-------------|----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Twig        | 0.42           | 0.65           | 0.24            |
| Go Template | 0.94           | 0.90           | 7.80            |
| Pongo2      | 0.86           | 0.90           | 4.46            |
| Stick       | 3.84           | 15.77          | 54.72           |
| QuickTemplate | 0.02         | N/A            | N/A             |

*Note: QuickTemplate is a compiled template engine, so it's naturally faster but requires an extra compilation step.*

## Relative Performance 

Performance ratio comparing Twig to other engines (values less than 1.0 mean Twig is faster):

| Comparison    | Simple | Medium | Complex |
|---------------|--------|--------|---------|
| Twig vs Go    | 0.45x  | 0.73x  | 0.03x   |
| Twig vs Pongo2| 0.49x  | 0.72x  | 0.05x   |
| Twig vs Stick | 0.11x  | 0.04x  | 0.00x   |

These results show that:
- Twig is consistently faster than other interpreted template engines
- The performance gap widens dramatically with complex templates
- Twig is up to **33x faster** than Go's html/template for complex templates

## Memory Usage Benchmarks

Comparing memory efficiency between template engines during rendering:

| Engine        | Time (µs/op) | Memory Usage (KB/op) |
|---------------|--------------|----------------------|
| Twig          | 46.49        | 0.08                 |
| Go Template   | 54.19        | 2.66                 |

These results demonstrate that Twig is significantly more memory-efficient than Go's standard template library, using approximately **33x less memory** per operation.

## Template Types Used in Benchmarks

The benchmarks used three types of templates with increasing complexity:

1. **Simple**: Basic variable substitution
   ```
   Hello {{ name }}!
   ```

2. **Medium**: Conditional logic
   ```
   <div>
     <h1>{{ title }}</h1>
     <p>Welcome {{ name }}!</p>
     {% if is_admin %}
       <p>You have admin access.</p>
     {% else %}
       <p>You have user access.</p>
     {% endif %}
   </div>
   ```

3. **Complex**: Loops, conditionals, and filters
   ```
   <div>
     <h1>{{ title }}</h1>
     <p>Welcome {{ name }}!</p>
     
     <h2>Items</h2>
     <ul>
       {% for item in items %}
         <li class="{% if loop.index is odd %}odd{% else %}even{% endif %}">
           <span>{{ item.name }}</span>
           <span>${{ item.price }}</span>
           {% if item.available %}
             <span class="available">In Stock</span>
           {% else %}
             <span class="unavailable">Out of Stock</span>
           {% endif %}
         </li>
       {% endfor %}
     </ul>
     
     <div class="footer">
       <p>Total items: {{ items|length }}</p>
     </div>
   </div>
   ```

## Key Findings

1. **Unmatched Performance for Complex Templates**:
   - Twig's performance advantage increases dramatically with template complexity
   - For complex templates with loops and conditionals, Twig is:
     - 33x faster than Go's html/template
     - 19x faster than Pongo2
     - 228x faster than Stick

2. **Memory Efficiency**:
   - Twig uses significantly less memory than Go templates
   - This makes Twig an excellent choice for high-throughput applications

3. **Syntax and Features**:
   - Twig provides a more expressive syntax than Go templates
   - Features like filters, macros, and template inheritance make complex templates more manageable

## When to Choose Twig

Twig is particularly well-suited for:

- Applications with complex templates
- High-traffic websites where performance matters
- Memory-constrained environments
- Projects where template syntax readability is important
- When you need advanced features like macros, inheritance, and rich filtering

## How to Run These Benchmarks

You can run the benchmarks yourself:

```bash
cd benchmark
go run engine_comparison.go     # Simple comparison of all engines
go run complex_comparison.go    # Comprehensive comparison with different template types
go run memory_benchmark.go      # Memory usage comparison
```

## Conclusion

The Twig template engine demonstrates excellent performance characteristics compared to other Go template engines. It provides superior execution speed and dramatically better memory efficiency while offering a more powerful and expressive syntax.

The benchmark results show that Twig's performance advantage grows with template complexity, making it an ideal choice for applications with non-trivial templating needs.
