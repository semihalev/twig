# Twig Implementation Progress

## Completed Features

1. **Parser Improvements**
   - Added parser support for function syntax with arguments
   - Added parser support for new operators: 'is', 'is not', 'matches', 'starts with', 'ends with', 'not in'
   - Added parser support for test conditions ('is defined', 'is empty', etc.)
   - Added conditional expressions (ternary operators)
   - Added array literal support
   - Added evaluator implementations for the new node types

2. **Full Filter Support**
   - Fixed filter parsing and evaluation to properly handle the pipe (`|`) character in the tokenizer/parser
   - Ensured filter arguments are passed correctly to filter functions
   - Implemented support for chained filters (e.g., `var|filter1|filter2`)
   - Verified comprehensive set of standard Twig filters work correctly:
     - Text manipulation: `upper`, `lower`, `capitalize`, `trim`, etc.
     - Array manipulation: `join`, `split`, `slice`, `sort`, etc.
     - Type conversion: `length/count`, `keys`, etc.
     - Formatting: `date`, `number_format`, etc.
   - Added extensive tests for all filter functionality

3. **Documentation**
   - Updated README with filter information and examples
   - Added comprehensive test suite for filters with various use cases

## Recent Improvements

1. **Custom Filter and Function Registration**
   - Added `AddFilter()` method to easily register custom filters
   - Added `AddFunction()` method to easily register custom functions
   - Added `AddTest()` method to register custom tests
   - Created `CustomExtension` type for comprehensive extensions
   - Added `RegisterExtension()` method for registering extension bundles
   - Created example application demonstrating custom extensions

## Future Improvements

1. **Optimize Filter Chain Processing**
   - Current implementation processes each filter individually, could optimize for common filter chains

2. **More Tests**
   - Add more comprehensive tests for edge cases
   - Add benchmarking tests

3. **Error Handling**
   - Improve error messages for filter-related issues
   - Add better debugging support
   
4. **Template Caching**
   - Implement a more robust template caching system
