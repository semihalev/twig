# Twig Implementation Progress

## Completed Features

1. **Parser Improvements**
   - Added parser support for function syntax with arguments

   - Added parser support for test conditions ('is defined', 'is empty', etc.)
   - Added conditional expressions (ternary operators)
   - Added array literal support
   - Added evaluator implementations for the new node types

2. **Full Filter Support**
   - Fixed filter parsing and evaluation to properly handle the pipe (`|`) character in the tokenizer/parser
   - Ensured filter arguments are passed correctly to filter functions
   - Implemented support for chained filters (e.g., `var|filter1|filter2`)
   - Verified comprehensive set of standard Twig filters work correctly:
     - Text manipulation: `upper`, `lower`, `capitalize`, `trim`, etc.
     - Array manipulation: `join`, `split`, `slice`, `sort`, etc.
     - Type conversion: `length/count`, `keys`, etc.
     - Formatting: `date`, `number_format`, etc.
   - Added extensive tests for all filter functionality

3. **Documentation**
   - Updated README with filter information and examples
   - Added comprehensive test suite for filters with various use cases

   - Fixed exponentiation operator (^) parsing and evaluation
   - Fixed string concatenation operator (~) for multiple concatenations
   - Implemented proper operator precedence system for expressions
   - Added support for modulo operator (%)

   - Fixed critical issue with `{% if foo is defined and foo > 5 %}` patterns when foo is undefined
   - Enhanced parser to correctly handle complex expressions
   - Added comprehensive tests for all operators and precedence rules
   - Fixed tokenizer to properly identify operators in all contexts
   - Improved expression tree building to respect operator precedence
